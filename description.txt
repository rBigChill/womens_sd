The Lakeside Police Department is sponsoring a series of self-defense classes for its female, elderly, disabled, and younger residents. These classes will be taught by Officer Katherine Miller, a police officer since 2002 and a specialist in preventative services. Officer Miller is offering these classes for free. The first class is for women ages 14 and older. Women should come comfortably dressed with sneakers. The class lasts approximately two hours. The class is scheduled for September 26 at 2:00 P.M. at the Lakeside Community Center. If you have any questions about the class, please contact Officer Miller directly at 555-2915.
